# WIN32Forth-Guide
Based on Win32Forth.
I wrote this guide as I worked through W323F referring to source code. Hopefully it will reduce your need also to so.
It is a never-to-be-finished project. There are many noted points of gaps or uncertianty.
Please send me any changes or additions. Just the changes, not a full, marked-up copy.
Send changes or additions to bill@billragsdale.cc
If you take it in a new direction, at least give me credit.
